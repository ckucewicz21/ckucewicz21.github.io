## Data Science Portfolio
I have been teaching myself how to code through online courses and additional resources ("Analyzing Baseball Data in R" by Jim Albert and Max Marchi; and "Intro to Statistical Learning with Applications in R", Springer Texts in Statistics). 
Right now, I'm learning Python through Codecademy's 'Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist' online program. Below are some of projects I've completed on my learning journey.
